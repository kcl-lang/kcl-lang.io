## Introduction

The KCL team is pleased to announce that **KCL v0.11.0 is now available**! This release has brought two key updates to everyone

- _Enhance the coding experience and efficiency with a more performant, feature-rich, and less error-prone KCL language, toolchain, and IDE._
- _A more comprehensive and diverse set of standard libraries, third-party libraries, and community ecosystem integrations, covering different application scenarios and requirements._

[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang) is an open-source, constraint-based record and functional language hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). KCL improves the writing of numerous complex configurations, such as cloud-native scenarios, through its mature programming language technology and practice. It is dedicated to building better modularity, scalability, and stability around configurations, simpler logic writing, faster automation, and great built-in or API-driven integrations.

## üìö Key Updates

### üîß Core Features

#### Language

- KCL supports Alpine Linux(musl) platform.
- KCL refactored the implementation of the Parser and reorganized the parse process of import dependencies.
- KCL optimized the type parsing of ** expressions in schema attributes.
- KCL fixed the problem that lambda expressions do not work when nested calls.
- KCL fixed the memory leak problem of schema mixin parse.
- KCL fixed the type promotion in function call expressions in assignment statements with type declarations.
- KCL fixed the error of lambda functions calling attr in mixin


#### Toolchain

- Package management tool version selection algorithm is released. In v0.11.0, the KCL package management tool supports the selection of different version numbers of the same tripartite library that appears in the dependency graph. The KCL package management tool refers to the mvs algorithm of go mod. 

To ensure as much compatibility as possible, package management tools currently prefer to select the latest version that appears in the dependency diagram rather than the latest version that has already been released.

In version v0.11.0, version selection is turned off by default. You can control whether version selection is turned on by setting the environment variable `export KPM_FEATURE_GATES='SupportMVS=true'`.

- Package management tool added a new local tripartite library cache. In v0.11.0, KCL package management tool implemented a new local tripartite library cache, and the new storage cache structure improved the performance of downloading git repositories by 88% on average.

In v0.11.0, the new cache structure is turned off by default, and the new local tripartite library cache is controlled by setting the environment variable `export KPM_FEATURE_GATES=' SupportNewStorage=true'`.

- Fix `kcl fmt` formatting error for code comments.
- Fix `kcl fmt` error in handling line continuation and comment combinations.

#### IDE

- KCL IntelliJ plugin released 0.4.0, supporting LSP4IJ.
- IDE can complete schemas defined in the worksace but not imported , and automatically insert the import statements of the package.
